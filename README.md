## Commit practice
For commit messages I am following the convention laid out in this article - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/
Also from this thread - https://hashnode.com/post/which-commit-message-convention-do-you-use-at-work-ck3e4jbdd00zyo4s1h7mc7e0g
Following this practice is probably superflous but thought it would be a nice little extra to practice on with this project, this structure is to be followed from this readme commit onwards.
